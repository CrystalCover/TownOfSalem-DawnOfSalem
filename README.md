# TownOfSalem-DawnOfSalem
This is for the Steam version only.

The following are included:
- **AmbusherTagger**: When the player encounters a living Ambusher while visiting their target, the latter's role will be set to Ambusher.
- **AutoLogin (semi-complete)**: If the user had the "Remember Me" option enabled previously, they will be automatically logged in on application launch.
- **BlackmailerSelfHearingFixer**: Blackmailers will no longer "hear" their own whispers as if they were coming from someone else.
- **DeathAnnouncementsInChatBox**: When deaths are being announced, the messages appearing in the chat log will also appear in the chat box. (e.g. "He was killed by a member of the Mafia.")
- **FixedLobbyRoleLists**: The role list in non-custom lobbies will always show the full role list, regardless of the number of players in the lobby.
- **FriendStatusNotifier**: When a friend goes online or offline, a toaster notification, if enabled, will appear on the home screen.
- **FullMoonNoticeHider**: In games where there is no possibility of a Werewolf or a Juggernaut (e.g. Classic mode), the full moon notice will not appear.
- **InGameMessageFilterEnhancer (semi-complete)**: Name references (e.g. whispers) are now also filtered with player messages.
- **InGameRoleListFixer**: The in-game role list is adjusted alphabetically and better organized. For example, Juggernaut will appear under Neutral Killing, Mafia Killing will appear under Random Mafia. These don't affect role selection in custom lobbies.
- **InvestigatorResultsAdjuster**: Investigators will only receive possible roles in their results now. (e.g. "Your target could be Medium or Retributionist." in Classic mode)
- **JudgementVotesSorter**: At the end of the votation for a trial, the players' votes will be sorted based on their numbers.
- **MoreExtendedPlayerNumbers**: Some name references did not have player numbers with them, they do now. Players' numbers now appear during name selection. The victory message will now also be sorted based on the winning players' numbers.
- **NonSteamLoginFixer**: When the application is run without Steam (directly from the executable), it is now possible to log in.
- **RoleCardRoleListGraveyardHider**: The graveyard, the role list (except for games with a custom role list), and the role card panels will be automatically closed upon game startup.
- **StoryAndPatchNotesOnHomeScreen (incomplete)**: The story and the patch notes buttons on the login screen are supposed to appear on the home screen.

None of these features are optional for now.

Feel free to download and build the project for testing, feedback, and suggestions!
